Pending kernel upgrade!
Running kernel version:
  6.8.0-31-generic
Diagnostics:
  The currently running kernel version is not the expected kernel version 6.8.0-35-generic.

Restarting the system to load the new kernel will not be handled automatically, so you should consider rebooting.

Restarting services...

Service restarts being deferred:
 /etc/needrestart/restart.d/dbus.service
 systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
 systemctl restart unattended-upgrades.service

No containers need to be restarted.

User sessions running outdated binaries:
 rashad @ session #4: sshd[1693,1758]
 rashad @ user manager service: systemd[1697]
 root @ session #3: login[1629]
 root @ user manager service: systemd[1532]

No VM guests are running outdated hypervisor (qemu) binaries on this host.
